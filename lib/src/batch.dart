/// **AlgoliaBatch**
/// A [AlgoliaBatch] is a series of write operations to be performed as one unit.
///
/// Operations done on a [AlgoliaBatch] do not take effect until you [commit].
///
/// Once committed, no further operations can be performed on the [AlgoliaBatch],
/// nor can it be committed again.
///
/// Creates a write batch, used for performing multiple writes as a single
/// atomic operation.
///
/// Perform multiple write operations in a single API call.
///
/// In order to reduce the amount of time spent on network round trips, you
/// can perform multiple write operations at once. All operations will be
/// applied in the order they are specified.
///
/// **Operations you can batch**
/// The following actions are supported:
///   - `addObject`: Add an object. Equivalent to Add an object without ID.
///   - `updateObject`: Add or replace an existing object. You must set the
///      objectID attribute to indicate the object to update. Equivalent to
///      Add/update an object by ID.
///   - `partialUpdateObject`: Partially update an object. You must set the
///      objectID attribute to indicate the object to update. Equivalent to
///      Partially update an object.
///   - `partialUpdateObjectNoCreate`: Same as partialUpdateObject, except
///      that the object is not created if the object designed by objectID
///      does not exist.
///   - `deleteObject`: Delete an object. You must set the objectID attribute
///      to indicate the object to delete. Equivalent to Delete an object.
///   - `delete`: Delete the index. Equivalent to Delete an index.
///   - `clear`: Remove the index’s content, but keep settings and index-
///      specific API keys untouched. Equivalent to Clear objects.
